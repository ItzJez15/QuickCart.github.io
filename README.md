Background: I am a Bachelor of Arts with Honours, Honours Digital Media undergraduate student from SIM (Singapore) under the University of Stirling doing a Digital Project (research) for my final year. This is a solo project with a supervisor in charge.
My project aims to observe how ‘Attention Economy’ marketing strategies affect and influence consumers’ choices and actions when online shopping, particularly on fast fashion websites. Additionally, to see what is being clicked on, how you as a participant navigate a fast fashion website, and whether interacting with prompts using targeted advertising (eg. 'Selected for you') and gamified elements (eg. Flash sales) influence your decisions to purchase the item.
My project will be an ‘online shopping simulator’ (A website-looking game) that I designed to simulate/replicate the appearance of fast fashion websites so that being a participant you are immersed in the same fast fashion shopping environment.
